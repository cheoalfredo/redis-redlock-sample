# redis-redlock-sample

This is a sample redis redlock implementation for a dotnet webapi using RedLock.net by Sam Cook https://github.com/samcook/RedLock.net

To keep in mind, this is an exercise i did to put to test this concept (The Redis Redlock Algorithm), however taking a look at this library (at the moment of the writing of the article) the last commit was April 13 2022 so you should consider using a more modern library for this. I.E: https://github.com/kidfashion/redlock-cs has activity until April 11 2023.
